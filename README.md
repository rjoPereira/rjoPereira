Hi, Iâ€™m Ricardo Pereira, a Computer Science and Engineering student at FCT-NOVA.

I love to do backend programing but I can also do frontend. I have a burning passion for Linux, especially for Arch, and for open source software.

On my free time I like to do puzzles, play video games or Magic: The Gathering.
